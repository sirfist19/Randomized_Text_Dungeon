Cole's suggestions

-add more rooms
-temperature - immersion
-spawn dude that you can sell stuff to (junk dealer)
	->has a set amt of money that he can use to buy your stuff
	->has small items

-bow has arrows with the counter down
	->like bullet seed
-crits 
-weapons breaking - damaged, worn, new, lightly used
	->crafting two same items together would heal the item

-make min gold amt higher 
-examining stuff in rooms (waterfall)
-open gold chest, open wooden chest (make it be recognized)


-maybe certain enemies can only spawn in certain room (slime 
-a message saying "You've gone into a new deeper area - be prepared for harder enemies"
-"still interested" or "still want it?" or "still want em?"
-stealing from the shopkeeper as an easter egg boss fight
-open chest when there is no chest - "There is no chest in this room"
-armored skeleton 
-puzzles

Mossy room -> moss to examine
Small room -> pedistal (has an item on top of it, taking the item sometimes triggers a trap)
Pit room -> pit
Dinning room -> table and chairs
Library -> books you can examine
Jail -> find a non-live skeleton, underneath can find gold and a weapon
Great Hall -> pillars
Statue Hall -> statue, bright light
Lake Room -> swim in the lake to find a key or gold, or something
River -> a river that you must explicitly cross via 'cross river', you'll need boots of a 	certain type?
Lava Room -> bridge
Cavern -> 
Waterfall -> examine the waterfall and find a potion










-different attack choices
	-> light and heavy attack 
		-heavy attack does more damage but misses more, the light attack hits more often
-status attacks (paralysis, burn)?

-Level up choice between health and some base defense
-items to give a damage boost to certain types of weapons

-text map feature that maps out the dungeon as you explore it (add a coord system first)
-seperate dungeons (like level sections)
-add puzzles?
-stores - 
-



-drawing the map algo
	-> generate the map everytime the player types the map command
	-> draw 2 lines at a time (by y-coord)
	-> sort the coords by y-coord, and then the y-coords by x-coord
	-> draw line by line, connecting rooms that are connected with - and not connected with a 		space
